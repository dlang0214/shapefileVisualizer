Package Description

This package allows you to visualize shapefiles in your mobile phone using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android [1]. For sample purposes, a shapefile with the cantons of Costa Rica is provided [2]. The shapefile can be personalized by changing the filename on the "string.xml" and in the MainApp.featureLayerShapefile method.
